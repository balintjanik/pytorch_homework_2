# pytorch_homework_2
A homework containing preparation of data (image manipulation) with NumPy and a convolutional neural network written with PyTorch. I used transfer learning from Mobilenet to achieve shorter trainings. The notebook also contains some visualizations.

**Note:** the homework deadline has not yet come, so the Jupyter Notebook containing the solution has not yet been uploaded.
